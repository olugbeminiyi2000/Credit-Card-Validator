As a network analyst for a transportation company. I have received a visual representation of an optimized route map where each connection between locations has an associated cost. I need you to evaluate the provided image and determine the optimal path highlighted on it.

Instructions:
* Analyze the image to identify the nodes (locations), edges (routes), and their associated costs.
* Determine the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, considering the highlighted path.
* Explain your reasoning and provide the Python code that would recreate this graph and the optimal route calculation.
