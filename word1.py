The next issue in the task management application lies within the TaskManager class, specifically with the methods mark_task_completed and delete_task. The delete_task method is malfunctioning, causing problems when a task is deleted from the list. After deletion, the list gets modified, which causes the loop to skip the task that follows the one deleted, due to the shift in indices. This results in tasks not being properly deleted when multiple tasks are being processed or when there are edge cases, such as an empty task list after deletion. Additionally, the method does not account for when tasks are re-ordered after deletion, which further impacts its functionality. The mark_task_completed method is also experiencing issues. While itâ€™s supposed to mark a task as completed and reset its overdue status, changes are not being saved properly, especially when multiple tasks are processed at once. Furthermore, when a batch of tasks is marked as completed, some tasks' statuses might not be updated correctly, and the integrity of the task list is compromised. Your task is to debug these errors to ensure that tasks are deleted correctly, tasks marked as completed are properly saved, and the overall integrity of the task list is maintained across different scenarios. The goal is to fix these methods so that the task deletion and completion functionalities work as expected, even in edge cases or when multiple tasks are handled at once.
