Response 1 is better because it better fulfills the prompt's requirements by correctly handling the start game functionality and adding the 'Play Again' and 'Quit' buttons after the game ends. While it does have a minor issue with resetting the game after it ends, it successfully manages the core features, such as displaying the game-over message and the corresponding buttons. In contrast, Response 2 has a major issue where it fails to display the congratulatory message or the game-over message, and it does not trigger the 'Play Again' and 'Quit' buttons as expected. While the timer and button mechanics are functional, the critical elements of ending the game are not implemented correctly, making Response 2 less effective overall. Thus, Response 1 meets the prompt's criteria more effectively than Response 2.
