I have developed a capital city matching game in React.js, and I would like to convert it into a Python program. The game involves the user matching capital cities with their respective country names. When the user selects a capital city or country, they must match it with the corresponding pair. If the user selects the correct pair, they earn a point. If the pair is incorrect, a warning sound is played, and the borders of both selected items turn red. The game also features a countdown timer set to 10 minutes. Once all the correct pairs are matched, the total score is displayed along with a congratulatory message. Please help me implement this game in Python using an appropriate GUI library.
