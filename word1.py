Below is the corrected code, along with documentation and explanations of the changes made to fix the issues.


### **Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Fixing the Sorting in `display_tasks`:**
   - **Issue:** In the original code, the sorting used an incorrect approach by trying to index the list `["Low", "Medium", "High"]`. This could lead to issues if the task priority is misspelled or missing.
   - **Fix:** I replaced the sorting logic with a dictionary `priority_order = {"High": 3, "Medium": 2, "Low": 1}` to ensure a correct priority order. The `get()` method of the dictionary is used to safely handle cases where a priority value might be invalid, defaulting to `0` if the priority is not found. The tasks are now correctly sorted by priority from high to low.
   - **Time Complexity of Sorting:** Sorting the tasks based on priority still takes **O(n log n)** time, where **n** is the number of tasks in the list.

2. **Fixing the Overdue Status Handling in `check_overdue_tasks`:**
   - **Issue:** In the original code, the `overdue` status was only set to `True` for overdue tasks but wasnâ€™t reset for tasks that were previously overdue but are no longer overdue.
   - **Fix:** I added logic to check and reset the `overdue` status if the task is no longer overdue. Specifically, I first check if a task is overdue and update the status if necessary. Then, if a task is no longer overdue, I reset the `overdue` status. This ensures that the task's overdue status remains accurate.
   - **Time Complexity of Overdue Checking:** The time complexity of iterating over the tasks and checking their overdue status is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of tasks.

### **Summary of Time Complexities:**

- **`display_tasks`:** The sorting step has a time complexity of **O(n log n)**, where **n** is the number of tasks, because we are sorting the tasks based on their priority. The iteration over the tasks to print them is **O(n)**, so the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, i.e., **O(n log n)**.
  
- **`check_overdue_tasks`:** The function iterates through all tasks to check if they are overdue, so the time complexity is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of tasks.

### **Overall Improvements:**
- The sorting logic now ensures that tasks are ordered correctly by priority, even if there are invalid or missing priorities.
- The overdue status is now dynamically updated, ensuring that tasks that are no longer overdue are properly reset.
