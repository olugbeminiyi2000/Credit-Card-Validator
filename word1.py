Instruction Following: 2 - Minor Issue
While Response 1 attempts to incorporate the game mode selection, it doesn't fully follow the instruction to first show the dialog box for selecting the mode before displaying the game. In Response 1, both the game mode selection dialog and the main game window are displayed at the same time, which was not the desired flow as per the prompt. This results in a minor issue in following the instructions accurately.
Accuracy: 1 - No Issue
Response 1 appears to be free of bugs and inaccuracies. The code is executable, and there are no obvious logical errors or crashes. It correctly updates the score, handles button clicks, and processes the game modes. Additionally, edge cases like incorrect matches in "Advanced" mode are handled well (e.g., points are deducted).
Optimality and Efficiency: 1 - No Issue
The code is structured well, and there is minimal repetition. Functions like reset_button_color and play_sound are reusable and logically separated. The use of threading for the timer and handling of button states demonstrates a good understanding of game flow. No unnecessary complexity is introduced.
Presentation: 1 - No Issue
The code is organized, and comments are used appropriately to describe each method's purpose. The game logic and UI elements are cleanly separated, and the class-based structure is easy to follow. The interface uses consistent fonts, sizes, and layouts, providing a smooth user experience.
Up-to-Date: 1 - Up-To-Date
The libraries used (Tkinter, pygame, threading, etc.) are all maintained and currently executable. The code doesnâ€™t use deprecated methods or functions, and it adheres to modern Python standards.
