I have built a capital city matching game in Python using Tkinter and Pygame, which includes a ten-minute countdown timer that begins once the game starts. Players earn points by correctly matching capital-city pairs, with success and error sound feedback. Correct pairs disable their buttons, while incorrect matches trigger an error sound without points. The game ends if time runs out without all pairs matched, showing a game-over message and playing a game-over sound, or if all pairs are correctly matched, displaying a congratulatory message with the total score.

Please help me modify this code to include:

A 'Start Game' button that users must click before the countdown timer and matching process begin.
'Play Again' and 'Quit' buttons in both the game-over and congratulatory message boxes, so users can start a new game or exit after a game finishes.
