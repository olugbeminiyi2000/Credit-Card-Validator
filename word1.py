Below is the corrected code, along with documentation and explanations of the changes made to fix the issues.


### **Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Fixing the Sorting in `display_tasks`:**
   - **Issue:** In the original code, the sorting used an incorrect approach by trying to index the list `["Low", "Medium", "High"]`. This could lead to issues if the task priority is misspelled or missing.
   - **Fix:** I replaced the sorting logic with a dictionary `priority_order = {"High": 3, "Medium": 2, "Low": 1}` to ensure a correct priority order. The `get()` method of the dictionary is used to safely handle cases where a priority value might be invalid, defaulting to `0` if the priority is not found. The tasks are now correctly sorted by priority from high to low.


2. **Fixing the Overdue Status Handling in `check_overdue_tasks`:**
   - **Issue:** In the original code, the `overdue` status was only set to `True` for overdue tasks but wasnâ€™t reset for tasks that were previously overdue but are no longer overdue.
   - **Fix:** I added logic to check and reset the `overdue` status if the task is no longer overdue. Specifically, I first check if a task is overdue and update the status if necessary. Then, if a task is no longer overdue, I reset the `overdue` status. This ensures that the task's overdue status remains accurate.


3. **Fixing Keyword Matching and Negation Handling Errors:**  
   - **Issue:**  
     The initial implementation encountered two key problems:
     1. When the combined task title and description didn't contain a priority or negation keyword, the code attempted to use methods like `.index()` without checking their presence. This caused a `ValueError`.
     2. Partial matches with negation keywords (e.g., detecting "no" within "now") incorrectly negated high-priority words, leading to inaccurate priority assignments.  

   - **Fix:**  
     To resolve these issues, we implemented two main changes:
     1. **Presence Check:** Before attempting to access the position of a negation or priority keyword using `.index()`, we added a check to ensure the keyword exists in the combined string. This prevents unnecessary errors by avoiding invalid index operations.
     2. **Whole Word Matching:** We introduced regular expressions with word boundaries (`\b`) to ensure only complete words are matched. For instance, `\bno\b` correctly identifies "no" but ignores partial matches within larger words like "now." This prevents false negations and ensures high-priority words are accurately detected.

### **Summary of Time Complexities:**

- **`display_tasks`:**  
  - **Explanation:** The sorting step has a time complexity of **O(n log n)**, where **n** is the number of tasks, because we are sorting the tasks based on their priority. The iteration over the tasks to print them is **O(n)**, so the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step.  
  - **Time Complexity:** **O(n log n)**

- **`check_overdue_tasks`:**  
  - **Explanation:** The function iterates through all tasks to check if they are overdue. This involves a linear scan through the task list.  
  - **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of tasks.

- **`assign_priority` (Negation and Priority Keyword Search):**  
  - **Explanation:** The combined string (title + description) is searched for negation and high-priority keywords using regular expressions. The regular expression uses word boundaries (`\b`) to ensure whole words are matched, not substrings within larger words.  
  - **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the combined string. The `re.search` function performs a linear scan through the string to check for the presence of the keywords.

- **`assign_priority` (Error Handling for Keyword Absence):**  
  - **Explanation:** Before calling `.index()` to find the position of the negation word, the code checks if the negation keyword exists in the combined string to avoid a `ValueError`. This check uses the `in` operator, which scans the string for the presence of the word.  
  - **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the combined string. The `in` operator performs a linear scan to verify the presence of the word.
