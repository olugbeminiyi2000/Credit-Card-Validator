To enhance the robustness of the load_tasks() and save_tasks() functions, I made the following improvements:

Error Handling:
Added explicit error handling to catch and respond to specific issues such as file corruption or permission restrictions.

User Feedback:
Ensured clear, informative messages are printed when errors occur, improving the user experience and making debugging easier.

Code Documentation:
Enhanced comments and docstrings to follow Python's best practices, ensuring better code readability and maintainability.

    saving/loading tasks from a JSON file.

### Debugging Steps and changes added

1. **Improved Error Handling:**
   - Added specific exceptions to catch `JSONDecodeError` in `load_tasks()` and `PermissionError` in `save_tasks()`.
   - Included a general `Exception` catch to handle any unexpected issues gracefully.

2. **User Feedback:**
   - Clear error messages are printed to alert the user about file corruption, missing files, or permission issues.
   - Provides context about starting with an empty task list if no file is found.

3. **Code Documentation:**
   - Enhanced docstrings for both functions to clearly explain their purpose, behavior, and parameters.
   - Detailed comments within the code outline each error-handling scenario.

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **`load_tasks()` Function:**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
    The complexity is proportional to the number of tasks (`n`) in the JSON file because `json.load()` reads and parses the entire file.  
  - **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
    The loaded task list requires space proportional to the number of tasks.

- **`save_tasks()` Function:**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
    Writing the task list to a file requires processing each task (`n`) for JSON serialization.  
  - **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
    No additional memory allocation beyond temporary buffers for file writing.
