Hereâ€™s an updated and documented version of the `Facade design pattern` implementation, addressing the issues described in the prompt.


### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - The `UniversitySystem` class is only responsible for core business logic like adding students, enrolling in courses, and assigning grades. It doesn't deal with the user interface or menu handling.
   - The `UniversitySystemFacade` class handles all the user interaction, displaying the menu, and calling the appropriate methods on `UniversitySystem`. This class serves as a **Facade** that simplifies the user interface to interact with the system.

2. **Extensibility**:
   - If you wanted to add additional functionality, like updating a student's information or viewing course details, you could do so in the `UniversitySystemFacade` without modifying the `UniversitySystem` class itself.
   - The `main_menu` is now much cleaner, and you can add more menu options without interfering with the core logic of the system.

3. **Clean Design**:
   - This design follows the **Facade Pattern** as it provides a simplified interface (`UniversitySystemFacade`) that hides the complexities of interacting with the core system (`UniversitySystem`).
   - If you need to change the underlying system, like switching from file-based storage to a database, you can do so in the `UniversitySystem` class without affecting the user-facing menu logic in `UniversitySystemFacade`.
