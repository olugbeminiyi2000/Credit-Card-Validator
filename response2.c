Here's the evaluation of Response 2:

Instruction Following
Rating: 1 (No Issue)

The response fully follows the instructions by adding the required features: a shuffle button, restricted tile movement to adjacent tiles, detection of when the puzzle is solved, and displaying a congratulatory message. It also addresses the initial issues listed in the prompt.
Accuracy
Rating: 1 (No Issue)

The code implementation appears accurate, handling the adjacency check for tile movement and ensuring that the shuffle logic only moves the empty tile within the grid. The check_win() function correctly identifies the solved state. Additionally, the provided note confirms that the game ran successfully without any apparent bugs.
Optimality and Efficiency
Rating: 1 (No Issue)

The code structure adheres to good programming practices. The methods are modular, focusing on specific functionalities such as shuffling, moving tiles, and checking the win condition. The approach to tile movement and adjacency checks is efficient, and no significant code repetition or inefficiencies were noted.
Presentation
Rating: 1 (No Issue)

The code is clear, well-organized, and easy to read. Variable and method names are descriptive, making the logic easy to follow. The accompanying explanations provide a helpful summary of changes and reasoning, adding to the response's clarity.
Up-to-Date
Rating: 1 (Up-To-Date)

The code uses Tkinter and other standard Python libraries, which are up-to-date and maintained. No deprecated methods or functions were used, ensuring that the code runs smoothly with current Python versions.
