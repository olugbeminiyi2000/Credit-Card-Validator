The provided C code is a credit card validator that checks the type of credit card (AMEX, VISA, or MASTERCARD) based on the card number. Here's a review of the code's quality, security, and maintainability:

**Function Names and Clarity**

The function names are mostly clear and descriptive, but some can be improved for better readability. For example:

* `get_card_length` could be renamed to `calculate_card_length`
* `get_count_outcome` could be renamed to `is_valid_card_length`
* `amex_first_digit` and similar functions could be renamed to `get_first_digit` or `extract_first_digit`

**Code Quality and Security**

1. **Magic Numbers**: The code uses several magic numbers (e.g., 13, 15, 16) that are not clearly defined. It's better to define these numbers as constants or enumerations to improve readability and maintainability.
2. **Duplicate Code**: The `amex_first_digit`, `visa_first_digit`, and `visa_master_first_digit` functions have identical code. This duplication can be avoided by creating a single function that takes the card type as an argument.
3. **Input Validation**: The code does not validate the user's input thoroughly. For example, it does not check if the input is a valid integer or if it's within a reasonable range.
4. **Error Handling**: The code does not handle errors well. For example, if the user enters an invalid card number, the program will print "INVALID" and exit, but it would be better to provide more informative error messages.
5. **Code Organization**: The code is split into multiple files, but some functions (e.g., `get_card_length`) are not grouped with related functions. It's better to organize functions into logical groups to improve maintainability.

**Best Practices and Standards**

1. **Use const where possible**: The code does not use `const` correctness consistently. For example, the `get_card_length` function takes a `long` argument that is not modified, so it should be declared as `const`.
2. **Use size_t for sizes**: The code uses `int` to represent sizes (e.g., `count`), but it's better to use `size_t` to avoid potential signed/unsigned issues.
3. **Avoid implicit conversions**: The code uses implicit conversions between integer types (e.g., `long` to `int`), which can lead to issues. It's better to use explicit casts or avoid conversions altogether.

**Recommendations**

1. **Refactor duplicate code**: Create a single function to extract the first digit of a card number, and use it for all card types.
2. **Improve input validation**: Add more thorough input validation to ensure that the user's input is valid and reasonable.
3. **Enhance error handling**: Provide more informative error messages and consider using a more robust error handling mechanism (e.g., error codes).
4. **Organize code logically**: Group related functions together to improve maintainability.
5. **Apply best practices**: Use `const` correctness, `size_t` for sizes, and avoid implicit conversions.

Here's an updated version of the `get_card_length` function that demonstrates some of these recommendations:
```c
size_t calculate_card_length(const long card) {
    size_t length = 0;
    long test_length = card;

    while (test_length != 0) {
        test_length /= 10;
        length++;
    }

    return length;
}
```
Note that this is just a starting point, and further improvements can be made to the code.
