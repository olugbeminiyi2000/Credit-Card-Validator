I have a python code that manages the booking and reservation process for a hotel. 
There are some errors in the code that prevent it from running, I want to fix it, it seems like some syntax errors or other error you should check.

the code: 

 ```python class hotel: 
    def __init__(self, name, rooms):
        self.name = name
        self.rooms = rooms
        self.reservations = []

    def MakeReservation(self, customer_name, room_number): 
        if room_number in self.rooms:
            self.reservations.append((customer_name, room_number))
            print(f"Reservation confirmed for {customer_name} in room {room_number}")
        else:
            print("Room isn't available") 

    def ViewReservations(self): 
        for reservation in self.reservations:
            print(f"Customer: {reservation[0]}, Room: {reservation[1]}")

hotel = hotel("Ocean View", [101, 102, 103]) 
hotel.make_reservation("John Doe", 101)
hotel.view_reservations()

```



The prompt provides a clear description of the task context, specifying that the code manages a hotel booking system and contains syntax errors. However, it could be more specific about the types of errors expected, such as "syntax or naming convention errors," which would help guide the model's response. Additionally, the code is presented without proper formatting or indentation, which may hinder readability and make it harder for both the model and developers to interpret. It’s also worth noting that the prompter initially selected the wrong difficulty level, marking it as "Challenger" instead of the more appropriate "Medium."
