The selected response, **Response 1**, closely follows the prompt instructions, with well-presented and styled code. It includes proper documentation for the Python class and methods, which enhances readability. However, the explanatory comments provided do not fully align with the style and presentation guidelines, and could benefit from more structured formatting. Additionally, upon testing, the response code failed to execute due to an `IndentationError` on line 35. This error indicates that the responseâ€™s accuracy rating was mistakenly marked as correct, and other related aspects of code execution (e.g., syntax checks, mime-type handling) were overlooked.
