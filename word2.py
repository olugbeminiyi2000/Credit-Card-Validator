I'm currently working on a network operations team where we manage and automate various system tasks. One of our critical scripts, written by a colleague who specializes in Bash scripting, is designed to automate the execution of a Ruby script that processes log data using regular expressions. Unfortunately, my colleague is on an extended leave and isn't reachable at the moment. Our manager has asked me to ensure that this script is free of bugs and functions correctly across all environments. Since I'm not very familiar with Bash scripting, I was hoping you could assist me by reviewing the code for any potential errors or issues that might prevent it from running as expected. Could you please help me by checking the script for bugs or any potential problems? Here is the code:

```bash
get_file_name() {
	read -p "Enter a file_name: " -r FILENAME
	if [ -n "$FILENAME" ]
	then
		MYFILE="$FILENAME"
	else
		return 1
	fi
}
get_log_data() {
	read -p "Enter a log data i.e ipaddress, timestamp, httpmethod, statuscode, or responsesize: " -r LOGDATA
	case "$LOGDATA" in
		ipaddress|timestamp|httpmethod|statuscode|responsesize)
			LOGDATAS="$LOGDATA"
			;;
		*)
			echo "Invalid log data type."
			return 1
			;;
	esac
}
get_exit_choice() {
	read -p "Do you still want to continue 1 for YES or 0 for NO? " -r CHOICE
	if [ "$CHOICE" = "1" ]
	then
		return 0
	elif [ "$CHOICE" = "0" ]
	then
		return 1
	else
		return 2
	fi
}
log_regex_automation() {
	while true
	do
		get_file_name
		file_result=$?
		get_log_data
		log_result=$?
		if [ "$file_result" -ne 0 -a "$log_result" -ne 0 ]
		then
			if ! ./regex.rb "$MYFILE" "$LOGDATAS"; then
				echo "Error: regex.rb script failed to execute."
				exit 1
			fi
		else
			if ! ./regex.rb; then
				echo "Error: regex.rb script failed to execute."
				exit 1
			fi
		fi
		get_exit_choice
		exit_result=$?
		if [ "$exit_result" -eq 0 ]
		then
			true
		elif [ "$exit_result" -eq 1 ]
		then
			exit
		else
			echo "Your choice of exit was $exit_result, so app is still exiting..."
			sleep 3
			exit
		fi
	done
}

```
