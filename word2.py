Evaluation for Response 2
Instruction Following
Rating: 3 - Major Issue
@Response 2 includes an incomplete code snippet, omitting several key components that the prompt expected, such as the full initialization, game setup, and button configurations. The code cannot be run directly, as it lacks the __init__ method. This missing functionality constitutes a significant deviation from the prompt's requirement for a complete, functional code update.

Accuracy
Rating: 3 - Major Issue
Since the code in @Response 2 lacks necessary components, it raises a TypeError during execution, indicating a significant accuracy issue. Additionally, without a complete implementation, there are likely unhandled edge cases or aspects of error handling that are absent, further impacting the accuracy of the response.

Optimality and Efficiency
Rating: 1 - No Issue
Within the provided code, @Response 2 implements an efficient color-reset mechanism using the after method. Although the code is incomplete, the handling of color reset timing within check_match and reset_button_colors is well-optimized and organized in the existing snippet.

Presentation
Rating: 2 - Minor Issue
Although @Response 2 has clear comments and a generally clean layout, the incomplete nature of the code detracts from its overall readability and usability. Important elements like class initialization and other main game functions are omitted, making it challenging to fully understand the intent or structure of the code.

Up-to-Date
