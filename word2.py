PROMPT 1:
I am a software engineer at Dailyshift, tasked with building an efficient task management application in Python. In building this application, I tried loading previous tasks from a tasks.json file using the load_tasks() function. However, this function crashes with a JSONDecodeError when it attempts to read a corrupted or partially written JSON file. To address this, I tried saving tasks using the save_tasks() function, but it silently fails to write data if the file system has restricted permissions, leading to unsaved tasks without any warning or error message. I want you to help me check my code to help identify and fix the cause of these issues. Below is my current code: 

```python
import json
import os

class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self, filename='tasks.json'):
        self.filename = filename
        self.tasks = self.load_tasks()

    def load_tasks(self):
        if os.path.exists(self.filename):
            with open(self.filename, 'r') as file:
                return json.load(file)
        return []

    def save_tasks(self):
        with open(self.filename, 'w') as file:
            json.dump(self.tasks, file, indent=2)

```
RESPONSE 1:
To enhance the robustness of the load_tasks() and save_tasks() functions, I made the following improvements:

1. **Improved Error Handling:**
   - Added specific exceptions to catch `JSONDecodeError` in `load_tasks()` and `PermissionError` in `save_tasks()`.
   - Included a general `Exception` catch to handle any unexpected issues gracefully.

2. **User Feedback:**
   - Clear error messages are printed to alert the user about file corruption, missing files, or permission issues.
   - Provides context about starting with an empty task list if no file is found.

3. **Code Documentation:**
   - Enhanced docstrings for both functions to clearly explain their purpose, behavior, and parameters.
   - Detailed comments within the code outline each error-handling scenario.

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **`load_tasks()` Function:**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
    The complexity is proportional to the number of tasks (`n`) in the JSON file because `json.load()` reads and parses the entire file.  
  - **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
    The loaded task list requires space proportional to the number of tasks.

- **`save_tasks()` Function:**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
    Writing the task list to a file requires processing each task (`n`) for JSON serialization.  
  - **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
    No additional memory allocation beyond temporary buffers for file writing.

PROMPT 2:
As a software engineer at Dailyshift, I am still working on improving the task management application in Python. I have encountered a bug in my task priority logic when testing. The application is assigning "High" priority to tasks even when a word like "not" precedes high-priority keywords such as "urgent", "important", or "high". For example, if a task description contains the phrase "not urgent", the system should assign a "Low" priority instead of "High", but it continues marking the task as "High". I need help fixing this bug so that the presence of negating words like "not" properly negates the priority, assigning "Low" priority when a negation precedes high-priority keywords like "urgent" or "important". This fix will ensure the system behaves as expected and doesn't mislabel tasks.
Here is the buggy code below:

RESPONSE 2:
Here's the fixed code, along with proper documentation, an explanation of the debugging process, and a time complexity analysis:


### **Explanation of the Debugging Process:**

1. **Initial Bug Identification:**
   - The original function was assigning a "High" priority if any of the high-priority keywords (e.g., "urgent", "important", "high") were present in the task's title or description. 
   - However, it was not handling cases where negation words (like "not", "no", "never") appeared before the high-priority keywords. This meant that phrases like "not urgent" were still being marked as "High", even though they should be marked as "Low".

2. **Solution Design:**
   - I added a list of **negation keywords** (such as "not", "no", "never", etc.) to check for the presence of negations.
   - I iterated through each negation keyword and checked if it appeared before any of the high-priority keywords.
   - If a negation appeared before a high-priority keyword, I assigned a "Low" priority to the task.
   - If no negation preceded a high-priority keyword, I assigned "High" priority based on the original logic.
   
3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - I ensured that the function correctly handled cases where multiple keywords or negations appeared, by checking the position of the negation word relative to the high-priority keyword using the `index()` function.
   - The function now handles both negated and non-negated high-priority keywords correctly.

4. **Robustness:**
   - The function continues to assign "Medium" or "Low" priority based on task description length if no high-priority keywords are found.

```


### **Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the `assign_priority` function can be broken down as follows:

1. **Combining the Title and Description:**
   - The line `combined = (title + " " + description).lower()` takes **O(n)** time, where `n` is the total length of the combined string (title + description).

2. **Checking for Negation Keywords:**
   - The loop `for negation in negation_keywords:` iterates over the list of negation words, which contains a constant number of words (let's say `k` negation keywords). This part is **O(k)**.
   - For each negation, the inner loop `for keyword in high_priority_keywords:` iterates over the high-priority keywords (3 keywords in total, so this is a constant time operation, **O(1)**).

3. **Searching for Keywords:**
   - The check `combined.index(negation)` and `combined.index(keyword)` both involve searching for the index of a substring in the string, which is **O(n)** for each call to `index()`. Since we're checking each negation with each high-priority keyword, this results in **O(k * 3 * n) = O(kn)** time for searching.

4. **Final Priority Check:**
   - The final check `if any(keyword in combined for keyword in high_priority_keywords):` involves checking for each of the 3 high-priority keywords, which is **O(3 * n) = O(n)**.

5. **Overall Time Complexity:**
   - Combining the components, the worst-case time complexity of this function is **O(kn)**, where:
     - `k` is the number of negation keywords (a small constant),
     - `n` is the length of the combined string.

Given that `k` is constant (a fixed number of negation keywords) and the primary complexity comes from searching within the combined string, the overall time complexity can be simplified to **O(n)**. This solution addresses the bug efficiently while ensuring that the function remains scalable for larger task descriptions.



PROMPT 3:
The next issue in the task management application lies specifically within the methods mark_task_completed and delete_task. The delete_task method is malfunctioning, causing problems when a task is deleted from the list. After deletion, the list gets modified, which causes the loop to skip the task that follows the one deleted, due to the shift in indices. This results in tasks not being properly deleted when multiple tasks are being processed or when there are edge cases, such as an empty task list after deletion. Additionally, the method does not account for when tasks are re-ordered after deletion, which further impacts its functionality. The mark_task_completed method is also experiencing issues. While it’s supposed to mark a task as completed and reset its overdue status, changes are not being saved properly, especially when multiple tasks are processed at once. Furthermore, when a batch of tasks is marked as completed, some tasks' statuses might not be updated correctly, and the integrity of the task list is compromised. Your task is to debug these errors to ensure that tasks are deleted correctly, tasks marked as completed are properly saved, and the overall integrity of the task list is maintained across different scenarios.

RESPONSE 3:
Here is the summary of the changes made to the code block and the explanation of its time complexity.


### Explanation of Bugs Fixed:
1. **`mark_task_completed` Method:**  
   The initial bug was that after marking a task as completed, the task list was not being saved. This caused the changes to be lost when the program continued. The fix added a call to `self.save_tasks()` to ensure that the updated task list is saved after the completion status is updated.  
   
2. **`delete_task` Method:**  
   In the original code, deleting a task within the loop modified the list, causing subsequent tasks to be skipped. This was because when a task was deleted, the list shrank, and the loop index continued to the next item, skipping the one right after the deleted task. The fix was to exit the loop after deleting a task using a `break` statement to avoid modifying the list during iteration and causing unintended behavior.

### Time Complexity:

1. **`mark_task_completed` Method:**  
   - **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of tasks in the list. The method iterates through the list of tasks to find the task with the given `task_id`. Once the task is found, the status is updated, and the task list is saved, which is an `O(1)` operation. Hence, the overall time complexity is linear relative to the number of tasks.

2. **`delete_task` Method:**  
   - **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of tasks. The method iterates through the task list to find the task to delete, and deletion itself takes constant time (`O(1)`). After deleting the task, the updated list is saved, which is also an `O(1)` operation. Thus, the overall time complexity is linear in terms of the number of tasks.


This structure ensures both methods work correctly and efficiently, fixing the previous bugs and ensuring the task list is updated and saved correctly after each operation. The time complexity of both methods is linear, making them suitable for handling reasonably sized task lists.


PROMPT 4:
As I continue building the task manager application, I have just implemented the features to display all tasks and check overdue tasks. However, I am facing an issue after running a full test: where the overdue task check is not correctly identifying overdue tasks, and the display tasks function sometimes shows the wrong order of tasks based on priority. Finally the assign priority function throws an error if no high priority word is mentioned, either in its negated/non negated form and also words that match the starting characters of a negation word (e.g. "now" makes the priority words negated giving them "Low" priority instead of "High" priority). I need you to identify and fix the issues in both the display_tasks, check_overdue_tasks, and assign_priority functions. 
Here is the code with bugs below.

RESPONSE 4:
Below is the corrected code, along with documentation, explanations of the changes made to fix the issues, and the time complexities for each function fixed. 


### **Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Fixing the Sorting in `display_tasks`:**
   - **Issue:** In the original code, the sorting used an incorrect approach by trying to index the list `["Low", "Medium", "High"]`. This could lead to issues if the task priority is misspelled or missing.
   - **Fix:** I replaced the sorting logic with a dictionary `priority_order = {"High": 3, "Medium": 2, "Low": 1}` to ensure a correct priority order. The `get()` method of the dictionary is used to safely handle cases where a priority value might be invalid, defaulting to `0` if the priority is not found. The tasks are now correctly sorted by priority from high to low.


2. **Fixing the Overdue Status Handling in `check_overdue_tasks`:**
   - **Issue:** In the original code, the `overdue` status was only set to `True` for overdue tasks but wasn’t reset for tasks that were previously overdue but are no longer overdue.
   - **Fix:** I added logic to check and reset the `overdue` status if the task is no longer overdue. Specifically, I first check if a task is overdue and update the status if necessary. Then, if a task is no longer overdue, I reset the `overdue` status. This ensures that the task's overdue status remains accurate.


3. **Fixing Keyword Matching and Negation Handling Errors in `assign_priority`:**   
   - **Issue:**  
     The initial implementation encountered two key problems:
     1. When the combined task title and description didn't contain a priority or negation keyword, the code attempted to use methods like `.index()` without checking their presence. This caused a `ValueError`.
     2. Partial matches with negation keywords (e.g., detecting "no" within "now") incorrectly negated high-priority words, leading to inaccurate priority assignments.  

   - **Fix:**  
     To resolve these issues, we implemented two main changes:
     1. **Presence Check:** Before attempting to access the position of a negation or priority keyword using `.index()`, we added a check to ensure the keyword exists in the combined string. This prevents unnecessary errors by avoiding invalid index operations.
     2. **Whole Word Matching:** We introduced regular expressions with word boundaries (`\b`) to ensure only complete words are matched. For instance, `\bno\b` correctly identifies "no" but ignores partial matches within larger words like "now." This prevents false negations and ensures high-priority words are accurately detected.

### **Summary of Time Complexities:**

- **`display_tasks`:**  
  - **Explanation:** The sorting step has a time complexity of **O(n log n)**, where **n** is the number of tasks, because we are sorting the tasks based on their priority. The iteration over the tasks to print them is **O(n)**, so the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step.  
  - **Time Complexity:** **O(n log n)**

- **`check_overdue_tasks`:**  
  - **Explanation:** The function iterates through all tasks to check if they are overdue. This involves a linear scan through the task list.  
  - **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of tasks.

- **`assign_priority` (Negation and Priority Keyword Search):**  
  - **Explanation:** The combined string (title + description) is searched for negation and high-priority keywords using regular expressions. The regular expression uses word boundaries (`\b`) to ensure whole words are matched, not substrings within larger words.  
  - **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the combined string. The `re.search` function performs a linear scan through the string to check for the presence of the keywords.

- **`assign_priority` (Error Handling for Keyword Absence):**  
  - **Explanation:** Before calling `.index()` to find the position of the negation word, the code checks if the negation keyword exists in the combined string to avoid a `ValueError`. This check uses the `in` operator, which scans the string for the presence of the word.  
  - **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the combined string. The `in` operator performs a linear scan to verify the presence of the word.



  Some of the responses include irrelevant time complexity analysis. This should be removed. Some of the responses do not address the problem of assigning priority well. Regex should be used rather than complex looping.
