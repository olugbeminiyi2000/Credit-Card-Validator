As I continue building the task manager application, I have just implemented the features to display all tasks and check overdue tasks. The display tasks functionality is supposed to show the tasks sorted by their priority, and the overdue task check should identify tasks that are overdue based on their creation time. However, I am facing an issue where the overdue task check is not correctly identifying overdue tasks, and the display tasks function sometimes shows the wrong order of tasks based on priority, I need you to identify and fix the issues in both the display_tasks and check_overdue_tasks functions. 
Here is the code with bugs below.
