Here’s the revised prompt in the first person:

---

### **Prompt:**

I have a Python program for managing tasks, and I need your help to debug it. The application allows me to add tasks, set priorities, display tasks, mark them as completed, check for overdue tasks, and delete tasks. The program works by dynamically setting due dates, adjusting task priorities based on descriptions, and notifying me when tasks are overdue.

However, the program isn't working as expected, and there are a few issues I need you to fix. Here’s what should happen when it’s working correctly:

1. The **priority** of tasks should be determined correctly based on their descriptions. For example, tasks with “urgent” or “important” descriptions should be assigned high priority.
2. Tasks should be displayed in the correct order based on priority, with high-priority tasks appearing first.
3. The **overdue** functionality should correctly identify tasks that are past their due date and notify me accordingly.
4. **Task deletion** should work without errors, removing the specified task by its ID.
5. Tasks should be able to be marked as **completed**, and their status should change accordingly.

### **What I Need You to Do:**

- Analyze the code to identify any bugs that are preventing the correct behavior.
- Fix the bugs, ensuring that the program manages, displays, and modifies tasks as expected.
- After fixing the issues, provide an explanation of the **time complexity** of the solution, particularly for the key operations such as adding tasks, sorting tasks by priority, checking overdue tasks, and deleting tasks.

### **What I Should Expect When It’s Working:**

- Tasks will be displayed in the correct order, with high-priority tasks appearing first.
- Tasks will be marked as overdue correctly when their due date has passed.
- Tasks can be deleted and marked as completed without errors.
- The program will function smoothly when these actions are performed.

This prompt now directly addresses the task in first-person language while providing a clear and challenging debugging task for the model to solve.
