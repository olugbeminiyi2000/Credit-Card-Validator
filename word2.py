Evaluation of Response 2:
Instruction Following: 2 (Minor Issue)
The response generally follows the prompt's instructions well, implementing the core game logic with Tkinter for the GUI and Pygame for sound effects. However, there is a minor issue: the game does not disable the correctly matched country/capital button after a successful match, allowing the player to select the same pair multiple times. This issue affects gameplay, causing players to accumulate points unfairly.

Accuracy: 2 (Minor Issue)
The code is mostly accurate, but it contains a bug that allows players to select the same country/capital pair multiple times, which breaks the intended behavior. After a correct match, the corresponding buttons should be disabled, but they remain active, leading to potential point accumulation for the same pair. This bug needs to be addressed for the game to function correctly.

Optimality and Efficiency: 1 (No Issue)
The code structure is efficient in terms of logic and readability. It avoids unnecessary repetition and uses reusable functions like select_country() and select_capital(). The game logic is straightforward, and the performance is not hindered by unnecessary complexity or repetition. The use of Tkinter's after() method for updating the timer and handling the game over condition is also appropriate.

Presentation: 1 (No Issue)
The code is well-organized, with clearly defined methods that handle specific parts of the game (e.g., select_country(), select_capital(), update_timer(), and check_game_over()). The UI is clearly defined, and the use of labels and buttons is simple and effective. There are also enough comments to make the code understandable.

Up-to-Date: 1 (Up-To-Date)
The libraries used, Tkinter and Pygame, are both current and maintained. The code utilizes up-to-date functions and avoids deprecated APIs. There are no issues related to outdated or incompatible libraries.
