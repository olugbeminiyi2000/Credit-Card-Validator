The provided code seems to be generally well-structured, but there are a few areas that could be improved for better functionality and error handling. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Error Handling for JSON Files**: The code does not handle potential errors that might occur when loading JSON files. It assumes that the files are always present and correctly formatted. You should add try-except blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` or `JSONDecodeError`.

2. **Input Validation for Player Names**: The code does not validate the input for player names. It assumes that the input will always be a non-empty string. You should add checks to ensure that the input is valid.

3. **Potential Infinite Loop**: In the `requestPlayerMove` function, there is a potential infinite loop if the player's move is not one of the expected values. You should add a limit to the number of invalid inputs a player can make before being forced to pass their turn.

4. **Type Hints and Docstrings**: The code could benefit from type hints and docstrings to improve readability and maintainability.

5. **Redundant Code**: There are some redundant code blocks, such as the `if wheelPrize['type'] == 'loseturn': pass` block. You can remove these to simplify the code.

6. **Game State Management**: The game state is managed through a combination of global variables and function arguments. It would be better to encapsulate the game state in a class to improve organization and reduce the risk of bugs.

7. **Magic Numbers**: The code contains some magic numbers, such as `250` for the vowel cost. You should define these numbers as constants to improve readability.

Here is an updated version of the code that addresses these issues:
