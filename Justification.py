Score: 8 (Response 2 is much better)

Justification:

@Response 2 correctly addresses the problem by implementing proper fallback logic to return the default python.txt file when a requested file is not found. This solution ensures that the web server continues to function even when the file isn't available, which is crucial for handling edge cases and errors. Additionally, it properly handles the URL parsing and the construction of file paths in a more structured and efficient manner.

In contrast, @Response 1 fails to return the default Python file when the requested file is missing. While it does parse the URL and attempt to locate the file, it does not handle the fallback mechanism correctly, leading to incomplete functionality.

Thus, Response 2 is much better because it meets the promptâ€™s requirements, handles edge cases, and functions as expected.
