Response 2 is much better because it fully addressed all the issues outlined in the prompt and provided a comprehensive, well-explained solution that performed correctly when tested. It met all criteria, including adding a shuffle button, restricting tile movement to adjacent tiles, detecting when the puzzle is solved, and displaying a congratulatory message. In contrast, Response 1, while meeting most of the prompt's requirements, had a minor issue where the shuffle method could inadvertently trigger the congratulatory message, potentially impacting game logic. Response 2 demonstrated better accuracy, contained no errors, adhered to best practices, and provided a more reliable and complete game experience.
