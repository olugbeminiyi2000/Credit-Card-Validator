I have developed a Python-based web server (webserver function) and client (webbrowser function) for local network interactions, but the server crashes with an error ('list' object has no attribute 'split'), and the client fails to display a response. I need you to analyze the code and identify why this error occurs, pinpointing the problematic section. Additionally, outline any other issues that could affect the codeâ€™s functionality and provide potential solutions, revising the request parsing and file retrieval logic as necessary. Explain how platform-specific path handling could contribute to the issues and suggest improvements for cross-platform compatibility and error handling. I expect a comprehensive debugging approach, including reasoning through the structure of the code, detailed explanations, revised code sections, and proposed test cases to validate the corrections.
