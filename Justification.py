I have developed a Python-based web server (webserver function) and client (webbrowser function) for local network interactions, but the server crashes, and the client(web browser) fails to display a response. I need you to analyze the code and identify why this error occurs and pinpoint the problematic section. Additionally, outline any other issues that could affect the codeâ€™s functionality and provide potential solutions, revising the request parsing and file retrieval logic as necessary. Explain how platform-specific path handling could contribute to the issues and suggest improvements for cross-platform compatibility and error handling. I expect a comprehensive debugging approach, including reasoning through the structure of the code and detailed explanations. I expect your response to contain the full code.
