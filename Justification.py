Justification:
@Response 1 is slightly better due to its clearer organization and slightly more robust explanation in both comments and docstrings. The class and method docstrings in @Response 1 are more thorough, giving better context to each section of the code, which is useful for understanding the logic at a glance. Additionally, the structure of the shuffle and move_tile methods in @Response 1 appears more streamlined, separating the logic of shuffling from tile movement more cleanly, making the flow easier to follow.

On the other hand, @Response 2 is also well-structured but has a bit more repetition and less clarity in some of the comments. It contains slightly more verbose and less clean explanations compared to @Response 1. Additionally, the PEP8 violations in @Response 2 (especially the line length issue) are a bit more impactful, which makes @Response 1 more compliant overall.
