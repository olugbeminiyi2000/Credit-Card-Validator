I want to develop a capital city matching game which involves the user matching capital cities of sixty countries in the world with their respective country names. When the user selects a capital city or country, they must match it with the corresponding pair. If the user selects the correct pair, they earn a point and a success sound 'success.mp3' is played. If the pair is incorrect, a warning sound 'error.mp3' is played. The game also features a digital countdown timer set to 10 minutes. Once all the correct pairs are matched, the total score is displayed along with a congratulatory message three seconds after the last match. If the timer runs out before all correct pairs are matched, a game over message is displayed and a game over sound 'gameover.mp3' is played. Implement this game in Python using an appropriate GUI library.




Please select a score to indicate which response is better.


1 Response 1 is much better


2 Response 1 is better


3 Response 1 is slightly better 


4 Response 1 is negligibly better


5 Response 2 is negligibly better


6 Response 2 is slightly better


7 Response 2 is better


8 Response 2 is much better

Please provide a justification. Use "@Response 1" and "@Response 2" to refer to the model responses.
