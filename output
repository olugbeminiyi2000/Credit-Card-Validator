Score: 2 (Response 1 is better)

@Response 1 is better because it correctly implements all the functionality described in the prompt, including disabling the buttons for matched pairs, which prevents users from selecting the same pair multiple times. This is a key feature that ensures the game operates as intended. Additionally, the logic for handling time, scoring, and sounds is solid and follows the requirements. @Response 2, while largely functional, contains a bug where correctly matched pairs are not disabled, leading to issues in gameplay, as players can earn multiple points for the same match. This flaw impacts the user experience and makes @Response 1 the better choice overall.
