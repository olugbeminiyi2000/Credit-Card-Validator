@Response 2 is slightly better because it accurately implements the requested feature of allowing the user to select the game mode (Advanced or Regular) before starting the game, as required by the prompt. It ensures that the mode selection dialog box appears first, and the main game starts afterward based on the userâ€™s choice. Additionally, it handles button states effectively, integrates sound feedback for correct and incorrect matches, and provides clear game status updates. While @Response 1 also implements the feature, it has some areas that could benefit from further clarification in handling button interaction states and game mode logic, making @Response 2 the slightly more complete solution in terms of clarity and functionality.
